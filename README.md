# instant â€“ transparent live-reloading

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/instant.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/instant)

Instant is a drop-in replacement for
[connect.static](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-static.html)
that watches all served HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

### Features

* Works in all browsers including mobile devices and IE6
* No browser plugin required
* Drop-in replacement for the connect.static middleware
* Production mode with zero overhead
* Automatic client code injection

### How it works

Instant automatically injects a script-tag right before the closing `body` tag
of any HTML page (including dynamic ones) in order to load the client code.

The client uses
[server-sent events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) to
listen for updates. Browsers that don't support EventSource will fall back to a
[hidden iframe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#Hidden_iframe).

### Usage

```js
var express = require('express');
var instant = require('instant');

var app = express();
app.use(instant(__dirname + '/static'));
```

If `{ watch: false }` is passed as option or `$NODE_ENV` is set to `production`
instant will behave just like `connect.static()` with no additional overhead.

### instant(1)

There is also an `instant` binary that can be used to spawn a development
server in the current directory.
The [instant-server](https://github.com/fgnass/instant-server) is packaged as
speparate module and can be installed via npm:

```
npm install -g instant-server
```

### Reloading dynamic files

The instant middlware also exposes a `.reload()` function that can be called to
reload arbitrary URLs. This can be useful if you want to reload scripts or
stylesheets that have been processed/compiled on the fly.

Note: If you don't want to server any static files at all you can safely omit
the  `root` argument.

```js
var express = require('express');
var instant = require('instant');

var app = express();
var ins = instant();

app.use(ins);

app.get('/tick', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Current date: ' + new Date());
});

// Trigger a reload of the page every 10 seconds:
setInterval(function() {
  ins.reload('/tick');
}, 10000);
```
